NFT Viewer

NFT Viewer is a React app that allows users to view their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by entering their Ethereum address. The app fetches NFT data from the NFTPort API and displays it in a grid of cards. Users can click on a card to view more details in a modal, including a description of the NFT and the owner's address. The modal also includes a button that allows users to purchase the NFT on OpenSea.
